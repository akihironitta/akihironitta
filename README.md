## 👨‍🎓 About me
I am a CS student 👨‍🎓 in Japan 🇯🇵 working on machine learning. I am interested in both theoretical and practical sides of machine learning 🤖, Bayesian statistics 📈 and computer science 💻 in general. In my spare time, I have contributed to several OSS projects for ML/DL that I daily use, such as, but not limited to [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/) and [Optuna](https://github.com/optuna/optuna).

## 🤝 Contact
I am usually active on Twitter [@aki_bayes](https://twitter.com/aki_bayes), and I sometimes use LinkedIn [Akihiro Nitta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akihironitta/) to look for internships and jobs.
